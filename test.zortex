# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of **artificial intelligence** that focuses on building systems that learn from data. Unlike traditional programming where we give specific instructions, ML systems ***learn patterns*** from examples.

## Types of Machine Learning

Supervised Learning:
- Classification: Predicting discrete labels
- Regression: Predicting continuous values
  - Linear regression
  - Polynomial regression
    - Quadratic
    - Cubic

Unsupervised Learning:
1. Clustering algorithms
2. Dimensionality reduction
   1. PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
   2. t-SNE
3. Anomaly detection

## Mathematical Foundations

The core equation for linear regression is $y = mx + b$, where:
- $m$ is the slope
- $b$ is the y-intercept

For more complex models, we use matrix notation:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}
$$

Where $\mathbf{X}$ is the design matrix and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ contains parameters.

### Code Example

Here's a simple Python implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

class LinearRegression:
    def __init__(self):
        self.weights = None
        
    def fit(self, X, y):
        # Add bias term
        X = np.c_[np.ones(X.shape[0]), X]
        # Normal equation
        self.weights = np.linalg.inv(X.T @ X) @ X.T @ y
        
    def predict(self, X):
        X = np.c_[np.ones(X.shape[0]), X]
        return X @ self.weights
```

## Advanced Topics

Gradient Descent:
The update rule for gradient descent is:

```
θ = θ - α∇J(θ)
```

Where `α` is the learning rate and `∇J(θ)` is the gradient.

### Performance Metrics

Accuracy Metrics:
- **Precision**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
- **Recall**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
- *F1-Score*: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

## Conclusion

Machine learning is transforming how we solve problems. From [Computer Vision] to [Natural Language Processing], ML techniques are everywhere.

Remember:
1. Start with simple models
2. Understand your data
3. Iterate and improve
